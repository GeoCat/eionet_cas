CAS is configured to accept a static list of credentials for authentication. While this is generally useful for demo purposes, it is STRONGLY recommended that you DISABLE this authentication method (by SETTING 'cas.authn.accept.users' to a blank value) and switch to a mode that is more suitable for production.>
